# ldm-cbct-sct
This repository contains the official code for a project exploring advanced conditional Latent Diffusion Models for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) scans. The goal is to produce dosimetrically accurate sCTs suitable for clinical use in Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) workflows.
